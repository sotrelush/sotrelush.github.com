              <h1>The New Crayola iPad App</h1>
              <h2> 10.12.11 </h2>
               <p>Kids love the iPad. They love to jab their sticky little fingers at its screen, they love to drool over its elegant glass and aluminum curves and they love to drop it onto floors, hard tiles and soft carpet alike. Clearly, they should be kept away from my iPad.
               
               But if you have kids, and you’re willing to let them use your $500+ tablet for such dubious reasons as “education” and “development,” then you might like to spend yet more money on the Crayola iMarker (made by Griffin). It’s a $30 stylus for kids which differentiates itself from other chunky styluses by looking like an actual Crayola marker, and by costing double the price.
            <img alt='Crayola' src='images/crayola.png'/>
               Thus equipped, your offspring can attack your iPad and record their scrawlings. A free companion app, called the Crayola Color Studio HD, allows them to do all the usual things kids do with crayons: coloring messily over the lines, drawing pictures of mommy so poor that they’d be a fight-worthy insult if done by an adult, and making machine-gun noises with their mouths while they draw trails of bullets raining down on “mommy’s” head.
               
               So why buy the Crayola iMarker in pace of something like the Alupen? Because it’s plastic, so when your progeny drops the thing onto the glass screen of the iPad, it won’t crack it. Available now, online or from Best Buy.

             <h1>New Magic Trick</h1>
             <h2> 10.22.11 </h2>
              <p>The linking rings is a good trick. I bought it from Nepo mall last Friday. It is worth Php 250. The trick is composed of 4 rings. The magician will show to the spectator that there are 4 rings and that there are no holes. Then the magician will link then unlink the rings. One of the rings can even give it to the spectator and let them check that there are really no holes. Then the magician will hold a ring and will ask the spectator to hit the ring 3 times with the ring that they are holding. Then the ring will link to the ring by itself. </p>

                  <h1>Varsity</h1>
                  <h2> 9.31.11 </h2>
                   <p>I am planning to join the varsity team this school year. I was planning to join the varsity team last school year but did not push through. I love playing basketball. This is my form of exercise. When I play basketball, I always wear my rubber shoes. When I practice basketball with my dad in our backyard, my brother joins me. When we are finished my mother gives us some snacks. </p>
